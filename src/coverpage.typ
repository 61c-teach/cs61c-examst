  Anything you write outside the answer boxes or you #strike([cross out]) will not be graded. If you write multiple answers, your answer is ambiguous, or the bubble/checkbox is not entirely filled in, we will grade the worst interpretation. For coding questions with blanks, you may write at most one statement per blank and you may not use more blanks than provided.

  If an answer requires hex input, you must only use capitalized letters (`0xB0BACAFE` instead of `0xb0bacafe`). For hex and binary, please include prefixes in your answers unless otherwise specified, and do not truncate any leading 0â€™s. For all other bases, do not add any prefixes or suffixes.
