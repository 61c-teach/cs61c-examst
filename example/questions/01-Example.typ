  Consider an 8-bit floating point format that follows the IEEE-754 standard, with 1 sign bit, 4 exponent bits (with a standard bias of -7), and 3 mantissa bits.

  What is the minimum distance between any two denormalized numbers in this floating point format? Express your answer as a power of 2.

  Consider the following multi-threaded code block.
  ```py
  int32_t a = 0;
  int32_t b = 2;

  #pragma omp parallel {
    while (b > 0) {
      a = a + b;
      #pragma omp critical {
        b = b - 1;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  If we run this code with two threads, what is the largest possible value of `a` after both threads finish execution?

  Note that the expression `a = a + b` is equivalent to four instructions: load the value of `a`, load the value of `b`, sum `a` and `b`, and then store the result in `a`.
